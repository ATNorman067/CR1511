	In the example webpage provided in the assignment, the 1st heading is sized the same as the 3rd, 4th, and 9th headings (1.5em, the default size for h2 headings) There's a possibility that it was improperly coded as an h2 tag, or properly coded as an h1 and styled to be smaller. As we were not instructed to use CSS, I've added inline styling to the h1 element in order to adhere to hierarchy and standards.
